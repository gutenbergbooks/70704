</div>

<p>There is a deep and growing conviction in the minds
of the mass of mankind, that slavery violates the great
laws of our nature; that it is contrary to the dictates of
humanity; that it is essentially unjust, oppressive, and
cruel; that it invades the rights of liberty with which the
Author of our being has endowed all human beings; and
that in all the forms in which it has ever existed, it has
been impossible to guard it from what its friends and advocates
would call <em>abuses</em> of the system. It is a violation of
the first sentiments expressed in our Declaration of Independence,
and on which our fathers founded the vindication
of their own conduct in an appeal to arms. It is at
war with all that a man claims for himself, and for his own
children; and it is opposed to all the struggles of mankind,
in all ages, for freedom. The claims of humanity plead
against it. The struggles for freedom every where in our
world condemn it. The instinctive feeling in every man’s
own bosom, in regard to himself, is a condemnation of it.
The noblest deeds of valor and of patriotism in our own
land, and in all lands where men have struggled for freedom,
are a condemnation of the system. All that is noble
in man is opposed to it; all that is base, oppressive, and
cruel, pleads for it.</p>

<p>The spirit of the New Testament is against slavery, and
the principles of the New Testament, if fairly applied,
would abolish it. In the New Testament no man is commanded
to purchase and own a slave; no man is commended
as adding any thing to the evidences of his Christian character,
or as performing the appropriate duty of a Christian,
for owning one. Nowhere in the New Testament is the
institution referred to as a good one, or as a desirable one.
It is commonly—indeed, it is almost universally—conceded
that the proper application of the principles of the
New Testament would abolish slavery every where, or that
in the state of things which will exist when the Gospel shall
be fairly applied to all the relations of life, slavery will not
be found among those relations.</p>

<p>Let slavery be removed from the church, and let the
voice of the church, with one accord, be lifted up in favor
of freedom; let the church be wholly detached from the
institution, and let there be adopted by all its ministers
and members an interpretation of the Bible—as I believe
there may be, and ought to be—that shall be in accordance
with the deep-seated principles of our nature in favor
of freedom, and with our own aspirations for liberty, and
with the sentiments of the world in its onward progress in
regard to human rights, and not only would a very material
objection against the Bible be taken away,—and one
which would be fatal if it were well founded,—but the
establishment of a very strong argument in favor of the
Bible, as a revelation from God, would be the direct result
of such a position....</p>

<p>There is not vital energy enough; there is not power
of numbers and influence enough out of the church to
sustain slavery. Let every religious denomination in the
land detach itself from all connection with slavery, without
saying a word against others; let the time come when,
in all the mighty denominations of Christians, it can be
announced that the evil has ceased with them for ever; and
let the voice from each denomination be lifted up in kind,
but firm and solemn testimony against the system—with
no mealy words; with no attempt at apology; with no
wish to blink it; with no effort to throw the sacred shield
of religion over so great an evil—and the work is done.
There is no public sentiment in this land—there could be
none created—that would resist the power of such testimony.
There is no power <em>out</em> of the church that could
sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained <em>in</em> it.
Not a blow need be struck. Not an unkind word need
be uttered. No man’s motive need be impugned, no
man’s proper rights invaded. All that is needful is, for
each Christian man, and for every Christian church, to
stand up in the sacred majesty of such a solemn testimony,
to free themselves from all connection with the evil, and
utter a calm and deliberate voice to the world, <span class="allsmcap">AND THE
WORK WILL BE DONE</span>.</p>

<p>Last winter, a Christian gentleman, by advertisement in the New York
Independent, offered a premium of $100 for the best tract which might be
submitted on “<em>Prayer for the Oppressed</em>.” The undersigned were nominated
and requested to act as a committee of award in this case, and have received
and examined a large number of manuscripts, many of which were of
marked ability and power; but finding no <em>one</em> of these so fully to answer the
call of the offerer of the prize as to allow them to award the whole of it to
<em>that</em>, they have awarded the same in equal divisions, to the authors of the
<em>two best</em> manuscripts, viz.: Rev. <span class="smcap">George W. Bassett</span>, Washington, D. C.,
and Rev. <span class="smcap">James A. Thome</span>, of Cleveland, Ohio. And they have strong
confidence that these tracts will soon come before the public, and that God
will mightily bless them as an instrumentality in inciting the Church universal
to benevolent action and believing prayer, for the overthrow of
slavery and oppression.</p>

<hr class="r25">

<p>Who are the oppressed? Those who suffer wrong from
the more powerful. They are to be found in all conditions
of society, in the bosom even of the family and the church.
All relationships which involve authority are liable to be
abused to the infliction of injustice and outrage.</p>

<p>Who are <span class="allsmcap">THE OPPRESSED</span>, distinctively? <em>The enslaved.</em>
These differ from all other victims of abused power in this
essential point, that, by the law, they are regarded not as
<em>men</em>, but <em>things</em>, the property of men. Denied humanity,
they are denied all human rights, and excluded from all
human relations. They have under the slave code as administered,
no legal protection; the show of it which the letter
of the law, in some instances, affords, being designed
rather to guard their value as property than their interests as
men.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Outcasts in society, they are outlaws in the State.</p>

<p>Overlooking this vital distinction, many persons hold that
slavery is one of the legitimate social relations, and therefore
not in itself a proper subject of censure; while its grievous
evils, the result of the abuse of rightful power, may justly
be deplored. But others, with a closer discrimination, discern
that the “chattel principle” which characterizes slavery
is inherently wrong, and that it is the chief promoter
of the spirit of oppression. It is believed that if slavery
were abolished, oppression would thereby be materially diminished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
throughout society. Holding this view, the people of
God are earnestly combating the slave system. The moral
power of the church, wielding the pulpit and the press, has
been increasingly arrayed against this stupendous wrong. A
more perfect combination of the forces of Christendom for
the overthrow of oppression is devoutly to be wished. But
this will not avail without the power of God. That power
must be invoked,—must be secured. The servants of the
Most High, who would have him honored and his cause promoted
by the extinction of slavery, must cry unto him day
and night,—must give him no rest, till he come and deliver
the oppressed. Fully persuaded of this, we wish to urge—</p>

<p><em>The duty and importance of praying for the abolition
of slavery and oppression.</em></p>

<p>1. The fitness and effectiveness of prayer as a weapon
against slavery claims attention.</p>

<p>It would be powerless in such an extreme case if it were
in itself a feeble instrumentality. But all things are possible
to prayer. What is the scriptural idea of prayer? This; it
is the offering to God of desires which his own Spirit has
kindled in the heart, with importunities which the same Spirit
prompts and sustains; it is also made with humble reliance
on the merits of Jesus Christ, and the prevalence of his intercessions.
Prayer, then, is not the work of man alone; he
is but a co-worker with God in this, as in every other gracious
endeavor,—with the Holy Spirit dwelling in his heart and
moving him to pray, and with Jesus the Mediator who presents
his supplications at the Father’s throne. This is the
view of prayer which our Lord discloses in John 15:7, 16,
Paul in Rom. 8:26, 27, and James, also, 5:16; “The
effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much.”
It availeth much, not because it is offered by a righteous
man, but because it is effectually and fervently inwrought by
the Holy Ghost, who dwelleth only with the righteous. The
power of Elijah’s prayer is referred to in the connection, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
illustrate and confirm the statement that all real prayer is
mighty. Elijah had no more power than other good men may
have; he had the infirmities common to the servants of God,
but the strength of Jehovah was with him; that strength was
in his prayer; and so it may be,—must be,—in all prayer.</p>

<p>The power of prayer, then, is God’s own power, exerted
by the Spirit and the Son through the supplications of the
righteous, and therefore it availeth much. Nothing can withstand
it, because nothing can withstand God. The elements
of nature yield to its control; the institutions of men, founded
in sin, fall before its cry.</p>

<p>If slavery were beyond the power of prayer, it would be
not because of its strength, but because it is right in the sight
of God. And if it be right, the Spirit will not move the
righteous to pray for its abolition. If God be for it, who can
be against it?</p>

<p>Let us then inquire whether this be a proper subject of
prayer?—whether a system of bondage which degrades man
into a beast of burden and of traffic is pleasing or hateful to
God? That it exists, and has endured for ages, is no evidence
that it enjoys his favor. Sin exists, and has prevailed from
the beginning. Romanism flourishes, and has had the ascendency
in Christendom for fifteen centuries. Idolatry reigns,
and the kingdom of Satan looks down from its ancient seats
scornfully on the kingdom of Christ. Among the most
dreadful exhibitions of God’s wrath and vengeance have been
those in which he has, with a high hand and an outstretched
arm, delivered the oppressed, and destroyed their oppressors.</p>

<p>Slavery is the foe of Christianity, the enemy of souls, and
it must be hateful to the God of love, who would have all
men come to Christ. It is opposed to the gospel and to every
evangelical work, to the tract, the Bible, the missionary enterprise.
It disregards the spiritual interests of enslaved
saints, and of souls perishing in their sins under its yoke. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
is a ruling power in this Christian country, to the scandal of
religion. It rises above other forms of sin, as the chief perverter
of the right ways of the Lord. It hinders the spread
of vital godliness through this land, walling about the dominions
of its chattels and excluding the preacher of the cross.
The Christianity it tolerates within its borders is not that
which declares the whole counsel of God; which cries aloud
and spares not, and shows the people their sins. The religion
of America, fraught with salvation for the nations of the Old
World, has been shorn of much of its power by the encroachments
of Southern slavery. Can any Christian doubt that a
system so hostile to the gospel is abhorred of God? And
now, at this moment, the issue is forced upon us, whether
slavery shall exclude the gospel, or be excluded by it. In
this crisis our only help is in God. We must be persuaded
that he will defend his gospel, and humble the slave power.</p>

<p>Note this, that slavery is not one of those organic vices
of society which are to be left to the reformatory influence
of Christianity operating silently upon them, but is rather an
<em>opposing force</em> to be directly and resolutely met, in the name
of the Lord. In the advance of civilization, ignorance is
gradually dissipated, but savage violence is to be encountered
at once and subdued. In the school, the family, the nation,
the church, certain evils admit only of indirect treatment, but
others call for decisive, positive measures. Slavery in a
Christian republic preëminently demands direct action, aimed
at its speedy extermination. It may long resist such action,
but no other is pertinent to its nature. When, after the
Revival of 1830-33, the attention of the people of God,
especially of the young converts, was turned to this subject,
they proclaimed the truth—Chattel Slavery is a sin, and immediate
emancipation is the duty of the slaveholder. With this
battle cry <em>the institution</em> was attacked by a host of witnessing
warriors clad in the armor of God. That onset had undoubtedly
a divine origin, and the principle that animated it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
true one, that slavery was to be swept away in righteousness.
And had the entire weight of Christian power sustained the
assault, and had the united energies of the saints in prayer
been secured, the quarter of a century that has passed would
probably have witnessed the downfall of the “peculiar institution.”
But many leading minds in the churches thought
it best to let slavery alone, and to leave it to the slow but
sure influences of Christianity, by which it would be eventually
extinguished. Twenty-five years have demonstrated that this
grievous system of oppression is not undermined by the gospel,
nor weakened by revivals. It has made most rapid
strides, and is now far more defiant of religious powers than
ever before. Shall not the teachings of the past suffice to
prove that in dealing with slavery nothing is to be gained
by <em>indirection</em>? Is it not time now, after the late gracious
revival, to renew and reassert the declaration—Slavery is
sinful, and must be abolished? Let this voice be raised; let
it be echoed by all the churches; and let the saints carry to
the throne of grace, and urge with faith and boldness this
plea,—“Great God! abolish slavery.” This prayer will be
acceptable, and will prevail, if God, as we are sure he does,
hates this stupendous sin.</p>

<p>2. The duty and importance of praying for the abolition
of slavery appears from this—that if prayer does not prevail
against slavery, slavery will disarm prayer of its prevailing
power, and reduce it to an empty form.</p>

<p>It is an accredited maxim that “praying will make us
leave off sinning, and sinning will make us leave off praying.”
The reason is obvious, and the application is plain. If indulging
sin in the heart is inconsistent with cherishing there
the spirit of prayer, the allowing of any prevalent sin in society,
on the ground that it is beyond the power of prayer,
is equally inconsistent. For this is to admit that its removal
is impossible with God. The alternative is forced upon
us,—either slavery must be overcome by prayer, or prayer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
be foiled by slavery. These two powers now stand opposed
to each other.</p>

<p>This is providential, and fraught with vital consequences;
as when Goliah and David met. Slavery is to test the strength
of prayer, the faith of Christians. Which shall prevail? Is
the Slave Power too strong for prayer, or have the saints such
faith and argument touching this thing, that they may ask
what they will, and it shall be done? It is a first principle
of evangelical faith, that, “all things are possible to them
that believe.” If this principle is yielded, the foundations
of prayer are removed. If <em>any</em> thing is impossible, nothing
is possible; faith that fears is dead, and prayer that quails is
powerless. If the servants of the Lord flee before the formidable
front of chattelism, instead of compassing it with
mighty prayer, and dragging it before the Lord to be slain,
they will betray a fearfulness which must preclude all acceptable
prayer. The great God loveth strong intercessors, strong
and bold, who “wrestle not against flesh and blood,”—weak
foes; but “against principalities, against powers, against the
rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
in high places,”—“praying always with all prayer in
the Spirit.” The only aristocracy in Christ’s kingdom is
composed of the princes who have power with God and with
man, and all who will believe may wear the title of this
order, “Israel.” But they must believe <em>only</em>, “lifting up
holy hands without wrath or doubting.” They must believe
only, not mixing fear with faith, nor trying with trusting;
that trying which first scans the magnitude of a sin, estimates
its power, and counts the cost of assailing it. The faith that
prevails in prayer has its sphere above the calculations of difficulty
and danger, where sense fails, and strength staggers.
It is just as easy for believing prayer to take hold of great
things as of small. The little English girl, languishing in
her mortal sickness, when she was told that Bonaparte was
preparing to invade her country, could grasp that national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
peril in her hourly prayer; and who will say that the threatened
invasion which might have changed the fate of Great
Britain was not averted in answer to that dying child’s intercessions?</p>

<p>Side by side in the Lord’s Prayer stand the petitions, “Thy
kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is done in
heaven;” and, “Give us this day our daily bread.” No topics
could be more dissimilar in magnitude, yet God hath joined
them together, and the believer passes easily from the greater
to the less. But let the petitioner put these asunder, and
pray for bread alone, as deeming the other too great a favor to
ask for, and his prayer will not prevail. God is honored by
that fearless, resolute faith which says, “Who art thou, O
great mountain? Before the Zerubbabel of prayer thou
shalt become a plain!” This great mountain of slavery is
the providential provocative in our day of the prayer of faith
which removes mountains. The aspects of it which most
dishearten man do most arouse against it the spirit of prayer.
“Is any thing too hard for God?” Is slavery too great for
the Almighty? We must either pray against this national
sin, or limit the Holy One to minor evils. We dare not do
the latter, we should fear to pray at all. To every intercessor
coming to the mercy seat, the gracious King says, “What
is thy request?” And if, despite the pressure of the times,
no mention is made of the crying wrong of oppression, he is
grieved, and turns away. It is as if queen Esther, going
into the presence of the king, with the fate of her doomed
people claiming her entreaties, had feared to ask so great a
favor as that their doom might be averted, and had only
craved for herself a new chariot, or a larger retinue of servants.</p>

<p>In this view of the subject, it is painful to reflect that the
theme of supplication which for twice ten years God has been
urging upon his people has been so strenuously excluded from
the prayer meeting, the monthly concert, and the sanctuary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Who can say how provoking this has been to the Hearer of
prayer, and how often it may have rendered the petitions of
his saints an abomination unto him? Had not the Holy
Spirit, with more than human forbearance, borne with the
manners of the people, and laid the unwelcome burden on
their hearts, and inwrought fervent desires, impelling many
to pray earnestly for the oppressed, there might by this time
have been little more than the form of prayer in the American
Zion. Yes, prayer for the oppressed has done much to
preserve the vitality of prayer in the churches! This has
been its happy reflex influence, although it has had to struggle
against much gainsaying of misguided brethren. When
it shall have prevailed against slavery, and wrought out the
deliverance of them that are in bonds, then will be seen, as
now is not, the irresistible power of prayer. We rejoice in
the assurance that prayer will overcome slavery. We have
no fear of the alternative. We are glad to have this decisive
test applied. Let it be seen in this crisis what the prayer of
faith can endure, and what it can do. It has other trials to
overcome, other triumphs to win.</p>

<p>3. The importance of prayer for the abolition of slavery
in this country, is shown from the inefficacy of other means
to effect it.</p>

<p>Every other mode of opposition has been vigorously employed.
The first minds of Christendom have written and
spoken against this monster iniquity. Its champions have
been forced to acknowledge, “The literature of the world
is against us.” But oppression laughs at literature,—it defies
the rostrum and the press. The moral influence of the
nation has borne against it with a pressure seemingly irresistible;
State and national anti-slavery societies with the motto,
“agitate, agitate, agitate;” mass meetings hurling the thunders
of popular indignation; Christian conventions uttering
the reprobations of religion; notes of warning from dying
patriots; appeals to justice and humanity from honored philanthropists;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
remonstrances from the purest divines; the entreating
voice of Christian women;—all these moral forces
have borne against slavery. But it mocks at moral suasion.
Political measures have been tried,—tried in good faith and
with the utmost energy. But the Slave Power, versed in the
intrigues of politics, has gained victory after victory, and
grown stronger by this species of opposition. Providential
events have signally fought against slavery. The successive
acts of European powers have swept chattel slavery from
their colonies. Cuba and Brazil, with our own country, alone
retain it. Repeated emancipations by individual slaveholders
at the South have kept alive the anti-slavery feeling. The
violent measures which the slave power has employed to fortify
and extend its dominions have exasperated and alarmed
the people of the North. For a quarter of a century this
movement of the people, of the churches, of political machinery,
sustained by favoring providences, has been in progress;
yet slavery in America is mightier to-day than it was at the
beginning of the movement.</p>

<p>Do not these facts show the duty and importance of prayer?
We are prone to try everything else before we resort to
wrestling prayer. We <em>have</em> tried everything else. We have
prayed, indeed; but chiefly to crave God’s blessing on our
other measures. <em>This will not suffice.</em> In such a desperate
case, prayer must take hold on the arm of the Lord, and move
it to strike the decisive blow. We must be convinced that only
the Lord can break every yoke, and bid the oppressed go
free; and we must realize that he will be inquired of to do
this thing. Not discarding other means, we must give the
preëminence to this. We must pray and faint not. Each
believer must alone intercede for the oppressed. Bands of
implorers must join in heart as touching this thing, and with
full agreement and faith beseech God to abolish slavery.
Intent on putting to the proof this last remedy, let the Christians
of America establish concerts throughout the land, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
closet and for social prayer. Let prayer be accompanied with
occasional fasting, in token of humiliation, for the sin of oppression.
This demon can be cast out, but not without
prayer and fasting. Christ is able to rebuke the evil spirit,
and to bid it come out of the nation. His disciples have been
trying to exorcise it, and have failed. Let them take the
case to him, and see if he will not work a deliverance. When
he takes it in hand, and speaks the word, there may indeed
be a deadly struggle, and the fell spirit, ere he departs, may
rend the nation and fling it on the verge of dissolution; but
he who is strong to deliver is also mighty to save. We need
not fear the issue. Do not some really dread abolition more
than slavery? The remedy is worse than the disease, they
think. But should Christians distrust the cure which their
Redeemer would effect? Here, perhaps, faith is most tried,—to
commit this work of abolishing slavery to the Lord, and
to have him cut short the work in righteousness. It may be
we have been secretly determined to keep off the dreaded
event which we are sure must come at last. They who have
been foremost as abolitionists and immediate emancipationists
may do well to examine themselves on this very point; peradventure
they are not, after all, prepared to see slavery
abolished at once! Where stand the people of God generally
touching this issue? Are they ready to trust the case in his
hands? Are they prepared to have every yoke broken, and
to see the oppressed set free? Can they be agreed to pray
for this unconditionally, dictating no terms?</p>

<p>4. That prayer for this object should be made without longer
delay, is proved by the extreme dangers of the continuance
of slavery, and of the strife it occasions.</p>

<p>Do we apprehend the evils of sudden abolition? We had
better consider the perils of prolonging chattel slavery in this
land of liberty. “Oppression maketh the wise man mad.”
Only the brutish man will long endure brutal treatment himself,
or tolerate its infliction upon another. If despotism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
breeds disaffections, slavery begets insurrections, as light enters
the house of bondage. And the light is advancing—fearfully.
Appalling dangers are just ahead. The mixed
race is rapidly increasing. The hottest blood of the South
flows in the veins of slaves, who are often scarcely distinguishable
in complexion from their oppressors. Abolition deferred
may come too late. Provocations, slight compared with those
of slavery, drove our fathers to rebellion. The worst passions
are inflamed by the atrocities of the chattel system.
The revolting scenes of the inter-State slave trade, the abominations
of slave breeding, the barbarities of the cotton
field and rice swamps, the ferocities of the slave hunt with
blood-hounds in the South, and with more savage men in
the free States, the imprisonments and lynchings of Northern
men found in the slave States and suspected of holding
abolition sentiments, the many collisions between slavery
and freedom, which have in some instances proceeded to
bloodshed and death, have caused much irritation and deep
indignation throughout the country. Freemen are exasperated;
good people are aroused; the moral sense of the nation
is shocked and tried to the utmost. The sentiments of patriotism,
devotion to the Union, and respect for federal law, are
lowered in the public mind. Faith in free institutions, and
hope of their perpetuity are seriously shaken. Sectional
animosities are rife. The republic is no longer a unit, for
the hearts of the people are sundered. Issues the most radical
divide us: freedom and slavery! There is determination
on either side, and strong feeling. There can be no reconciliation
and no respite in this fraternal strife. Nothing can end
it but the removal of slavery. Only this can avert the evils
that now threaten the republic. Emancipation or ruin is the
alternative which the tide of events is forcing on us. It is
now a time of trial, a crisis. The elements are fraught with
trouble. Peacemakers are abroad, but agitators are stronger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
than they. This is no time to cry peace. Men behold the
oppressions that are done under the sun, done under “the
stars and stripes,” and they are stirred. There is no leisure
for speculation and conjecture. Let no time be wasted in
idle fears, or in useless efforts at pacification. The conflict
must continue; God wills it! Let his people commit the
cause to him. Let them betake themselves to prayer.</p>

<p>And what shall be the burden of their supplications?
Shall they pray for peace, for a calming of the waters, for a
putting out of the fires of freedom which burn against oppression?
No, no! Let them pray <em>for the abolition of slavery</em>.
Let them not mock God by calling upon him to stay the work
which his providences have so manifestly been pushing forward.
Where are the intercessors who, in God’s light, see
light on this subject, who are prepared to enter into the divine
plans, and who will please the Lord by asking him boldly, in
faith, to put an end to slavery? Where are the wise and
discerning men, in whom is the Spirit of the Lord, who clearly
see that this is the only salvation to all the interests of American
liberty? Let them speak out, and summon the saints to
repair without delay to the throne of grace, in this time
of need.</p>

<p>By the several considerations foregoing we would urge the
duty and importance of praying for the <em>abolition of slavery
in America</em>. We would lay this solemn duty on the hearts
of Christians; we would earnestly entreat them to stir themselves
to take hold on God for this great blessing to the nation
and the world. We would humbly say,—Brethren,
quench not the Spirit, which may now be moving you to pray,
and may be waiting to work in your hearts the fervent and
effectual prayer which, poured forth by the help of his intercessions
and unutterable groanings, will avail much. Make
full proof, beloved, of the power of prayer. A better test
there could not be. Let it be seen that prayer can overcome
slavery. Make it manifest that what the literature, the moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
suasion, and the political action of one generation has not
done, the prayers of God’s people can do. Important interests
await this result—the nation rescued from ruin, Christianity
saved from apostasy. Emancipation gained by prayer
will avert emancipation wrought by violence.</p>

<p>Slavery done away in righteousness, oppression in its other
forms will be meliorated and will gradually disappear. The
apprentice, the clerk, the sailor, the soldier, the pupil, the
child, the laborer, the hired girl, the wife, will be more secure
from the abuses of power, when the spirit of oppression,
driven from its stronghold, is shorn of its strength. The
abolition of slavery in this country will go far to drive the
spirit of oppression out of Christendom, and to liberate the
nations of Europe.</p>

<p>Such results, rationally to be anticipated, should certainly
impel Christians to pray. The purity, the peace, and the
prosperity of Zion are so implicated, that to pray for the abolition
of slavery is to pray for these. The power of revivals,
the success of home and foreign missions, the operations of
tract and Bible societies would be increased immeasurably by
the overthrow of slavery, and by the augmented strength this
victory would practically give to prayer. The available energies
of the American Zion would be multiplied many fold.
The Bible would be vindicated, Christianity would have the
trophies of the triumph, and God would gain great glory.</p>

<p>Oh! then, who among the saints will restrain prayer?—Who
will come not up to the help of the Lord against the
mighty? Who will incur the bitter curse of Meroz? Rather,
who will not bear some part in this faith-struggle at the throne
of grace? Who will not share in the rewards which God
will bestow on his people, when he comes to avenge them
speedily by the overthrow of slavery? What praying circle,
what pulpit, what concert or closet, will be found wanting in
this crisis?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Prayer for the abolition of slavery involves <em>prayer for the
oppressed</em>. Ungodly men may oppose slavery, and yet have
little sympathy for the enslaved; but the Christian can not
bear the sin of slavery to the throne of God without bearing
thither the wrongs and woes of the oppressed. Moralists may
condemn chattelism in the abstract; but they who are moved
to pray by the Holy Ghost will “remember them that are in
bonds as bound with them.”</p>

<p>“<em>Who are the oppressed?</em>” we asked at the outset, and
answered, The enslaved. Again we ask, Who are the oppressed?
Who are these victims of slavery? Who are they that we
should pray for them? We answer:</p>

<p>They are <em>men</em>. They belong to the human family. They
are of one blood with ourselves. They have the same rights
with us, the same interests, the same desires, the same wants,
the same love of liberty, the same sense of right and wrong,
the same deathless spirits. The negro in his chains appealingly
interrogates us,—“Am I not a man and a brother?”
What can the Christian do but own the relationship? Is he
indeed a man—a brother? Then does not to him the golden
rule apply—“Do unto others as ye would they should do
unto you?” <em>Can</em> we exclude them from our prayers?</p>

<p>They are <em>innocent</em> men. By no hideous crime against
humanity have they forfeited their place in the brotherhood.
For no violation of law have they been consigned to bondage.
Against them, rather, has all law been violated, and every dictate
of humanity outraged. Guilty only of a colored skin,
and of inevitable ignorance, they have been doomed to abject
servitude. From birth they have been made property. In
their infancy they knew no mother, but merely a nurse; in
their childhood they had no home; in their maturity they
have no companions, and no children, but merely offspring,
like the brutes. Yet, they are innocent men. Sinners indeed
they are before a holy God, as are all mankind; but they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
innocent of <em>crime</em>. They are oppressed without cause. What
should hinder the prayers of the righteous in their behalf?</p>

<p>Many of them are <em>the children of God</em>, by regeneration.
These are our brethren in the Lord, one with us in Christian
bonds, “fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household
of God.” They cry day and night unto God, and their cry
enters into his ear. Our blessed Saviour would have us pray
for and sympathize with these his little ones, as we love him.
He is very pitiful towards them, and very jealous toward
those who slight them. Realize that they are their Lord’s,
that they are not their own, that they can not be the property
of their owners, that they are bought with a price. Regard
the enslaved saints as the Lord’s freemen; that their Master
hath need of them; that they are forbidden to call any man
master, on earth, for one is their Master, even Christ. <em>Can</em>
it be the will of Jesus that his own redeemed saints should
be held and treated as beasts? Will he not be grieved if his
followers who are free, pray not for the freedom of these their
brethren in bonds? When Peter was put in prison in Jerusalem,
“prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto
God for him,” and it wrought his deliverance. Let prayer
be now made without ceasing by the church, for the liberation
of all enslaved saints, and enlargement shall surely come.
The living God waits to be importuned by the church for its
own members. He waits to hear the cry of distress from
Zion, suffering with her suffering children.</p>

<p>The unconverted slaves are hopeful subjects of renewing
grace compared with the same number of any class of men.
No persons on earth are more susceptible to gospel influences
than the negroes. What the missionary has labored almost
in vain to effect among the Indians, among the Jews, among
the Catholic immigrants in this country, would, we are confident,
be done with large success among the slaves of the
South, if they were emancipated. Strike off the shackles,
and this Ethiopia would stretch forth her hands unto God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The oppressed are <em>a great multitude</em>. <em>Three millions of
souls</em> are crushed and brutalized by slavery. Three millions
of souls are robbed of every human right, and subjected to
every abuse and cruelty that the caprice, lust, or cupidity of
the slaveholder may dictate. The master is wholly irresponsible.
The slave plantation is a petty, absolute despotism.
From thousands of fields the blood of the oppressed crieth to
God for vengeance. Millions of groaning, sighing wretches
are appealing to Heaven for mercy. With these groans of the
enslaved will mingle the prayers of the righteous in their
behalf; and no doubt the Lord will hear.</p>

<p>The oppressed are to be regarded as having wants while in
their bondage which God only can supply; but it must be
borne in mind that the their great want is <em>freedom</em>. Let this be
sought instantly, importunately. Beware of praying for them
as slaves, as if their condition were unchangeable; this were
a grievous insult to God and to humanity. Pray for the
oppressed—that they may go free. Pray for the oppressors—that
they may break every yoke. Pray for the missionary
and the colporter—that they “may open their mouths boldly,
to make known the mystery of the gospel; that therein
they may speak boldly, as they ought to speak.” We may
be sure that God will not suffer the oppressors long to stand
between his salvation and the souls of the oppressed. We
may plant our feet on this firm assurance when we pray,—“The
Lord will open a highway for his word.” If he sends
his messengers to the south to preach salvation, he will stand
by them and will give their word success, though their blood
flow to seal their ministry.</p>

<p>Let it not be, O brethren, that our prayer for the oppressed
shall be less fervent because they are not of our own color;
lest it should appear that we have “the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.”
Were this so, how could the Spirit of prayer dwell at all in
our hearts? It were a crying wrong if <em>prejudice</em> should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
restrain prayer for the enslaved. He who has no pity for the
bleeding bondman because he is an African, is not like the
good Samaritan, is not like Christ, who died for all men, is
not like God, with whom is no respect of persons.</p>

<p>And let not our prayers be hindered by fears of what may
come after emancipation. The faith that is adequate to
prayer is also able to commit the results of God’s action to his
management. It is to be feared that some have become discouraged
by the growth and ascendency of the slave power,
and have no faith that prayer for the oppressed will avail.
Their trust is in political action, or in the judgments of a
just God, and the vengeance of the oppressed. Be not,
beloved, drawn into this attitude of unbelief and “fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation.” “<em>Be not
afraid</em>; <span class="allsmcap">ONLY BELIEVE</span>.”</p>

<p>What shall be the bearing of the late revival upon slavery?
It is a signal fact that each great awakening in this country,
including that of 1797, has been marked by the arousing
of God’s people to the sin of oppression.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the influence of the outpouring
of God’s Spirit in 1830-33, as giving rise to the great modern
movement in opposition to slavery. Simultaneously with
this, a strong dislike of it on moral grounds was seizing many
minds at the South. Various demonstrations of this were
made by religious bodies; and in some of the slave States
emancipation was seriously meditated and openly proposed.
The writer of this tract, a native of the South and a member
of a slaveholding family, religiously trained to regard slavery
as scriptural, and expecting to be, after the manner of his
father, a church member and a slaveholder for life, was hopefully
numbered among the subjects of the revival of 1830.
He consecrated himself to the work of the ministry. The
spirit of prayer was given him, with yearnings to be holy and
to be useful. His eyes were then opened to the moral condition
of the slaves. He saw those of his own household,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
though his father was a ruling elder in the Presbyterian church,
living without God, without religious instruction, without
moral restraint; he saw the young slaves, the fruit of promiscuous
concubinage, the playmates of his childhood, and
scarcely of a darker hue, (though happily claiming no blood
relationship, as those of some Southern families do,) growing
up in ignorance and vice. Deeply moved, he cried unto the
Lord that he would save their souls. He daily prayed for
those miserable creatures; he nightly bathed his pillow with
tears of pity and distress. But he found no relief; he saw
no ray of hope. He dreamed not then that slavery itself was
wrong, and that its abolition was the only remedy for the ills
of the oppressed. He knew not that many others were moved
as he was, and that it was the Lord who was thus stirring the
first impulses of a mighty movement for the redemption of the
enslaved. Just then, a tract, or pamphlet, sent by some unknown
hand from the East, was taken from the post-office. It
was on the safety of immediate emancipation. The very subject
riveted attention by its novelty and boldness. The tract
was read in secret, and read again, and soberly pondered.
Light broke in; new thoughts, new feelings, new hopes were
inspired. In less than one year, (1833,) the writer was a
member of Lane Theological Seminary, and an avowed convert
to the new doctrine.</p>

<p>These were some of the fruits of the revival a quarter of a
century ago. They have lasted till now. Opposition to
chattel oppression in this country is in great measure due to
that gracious work, and to the spirit of prayer which has sustained
and sanctified it. Surely we can not doubt that God
is in this movement. Another mighty revival has been enjoyed
by our American Zion—the most powerful, perhaps, of
the series. It has been specially characterized by the spirit
of prayer, which has been poured out in large measure, and
has wrought astonishing results.</p>

<p>It is now a momentous question: To what ends shall this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
renovated instrumentality of prayer, in the hands of a revived
church, and of a multitude of young converts, who owe their
hopes to it, be applied? Against what forms of sin and evil
shall this weapon be wielded? What embodiment of wrong
most invites this species of attack, by its opposition to everything
vital in godliness? Is it not American slavery? We
assuredly gather that it is God’s will there should be a special
and combined effort in prayer, to pull down this stronghold
of iniquity. We have confidence that the Holy Ghost, who
has given the saints a fresh baptism of prayer, will incline
them to unite their supplications against this abomination.</p>

<p>Christian reader! Will you not bear this burden to your
closet? Will you not make the bondman’s wrongs your own?
Christian parents! Will you not mingle with your thanksgivings
that your children were born free, importunate supplications
that the curse of slavery may be removed from
every family in the land? Young converts! Ye who, in
answer to prayer, have been liberated from the bonds of sin,
will you not plead with God to deliver the oppressed, and to
abolish slavery? Ministers of Christ! Will you not call upon
the Lord, “praying with all prayer and supplication in the
spirit,” and leading the sacramental host to the throne of
grace? Are there Christian households, and Christian sanctuaries
in this land, where the oppressed have not been habitually
remembered in prayer? Are there disciples who have
not sympathized with the sighing bondmen? Are there
“women professing godliness” who have been deaf to the
wail of slave mothers sundered from their babes? Let these
things be no longer, lest the cry of the down-trodden millions
call down swift retributions. May the spirit of grace and
of supplications be poured out upon Zion, until liberty shall
be proclaimed throughout all this land, unto all the inhabitants
thereof. So God grant for his Son’s sake!</p>

<h2 class="fs80">FROM A SERMON BY REV. E. N. KIRK, D. D.</h2>

<p>In addition to the reasons urging to prayer for the extinction
of slavery growing out of the character of the system, and the
condition of the oppressed, there are other reasons derived from
its influence upon the slave owners.</p>

<p>Of these there are three classes: the unwilling master—the
willing, but kind master—and the oppressor.</p>

<p>1. I know of no condition so full of trials as that of the slave-owner
who abhors the relation, but does not see that he can properly
terminate it. That there are many such can not be doubted.
But what a life must a godly man lead who has come to comprehend
its enormous wickedness! What must be his apprehensions
of the wrath of God upon his people, his country! If a man of
skeptical views, like Jefferson, could tremble for his country in
remembering that heaven is just, what must he feel who fully
believes that God is ruler among the nations, and that he hates
oppression! How painful must be his unavailing sympathy for
the poor oppressed beings whom he sees around him! How must
his heart be burdened as he observes the demoralizing influences
of slavery on both races; how often must his love of country be
pained with that just contempt which slaveholding in America
excites in every civilized nation under heaven; how painful
must it be to see no relief in any quarter, but, on the contrary,
everything indicating that the system is to be incorporated
into the whole civil and social system of the nation! And
to crown all, while many intelligent persons at the South would
gladly abandon slavery, no man has the courage to utter his
sentiments.</p>

<p>This class of slave-owners demands our deepest and most
compassionate sympathy.</p>

<p>2. There is another class who have been taught from infancy
by their parents, teachers, and pastors, that slavery is a divine
institution; they see no wrong in it, and consider all the evils as
incidental, and not as legitimate consequences of the system.
They are the most powerful upholders of it, because they believe
it to be right, and are conscious of no other than kind sentiments
towards their slaves. To such men and their sentiments
the oppressor triumphantly appeals as an evidence that slaveholding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
is not injurious to character, nor repulsive to the feelings
of good men.</p>

<p>3. Then there is the oppressor—the man in whom slaveholding
is a sin <em>per se</em>. He holds his brother as property. He
denies to man, for selfish ends, the rights and prerogatives of
manhood. He denies that the possession of life, liberty and
happiness, or the unobstructed pursuit of them, is the right of
every man unconvicted of crime.—But not to rest in general
statements, let us place side by side some facts, and some passages
of the word of God.</p>

<p>The facts are that slavery robs a man of his humanity. He
is made a thing, a chattel, merchandise. The African has no
right on earth but to do the will, and promote the comfort of the
Caucasian. He can not choose his residence, his employer, his
work. He can not receive wages or the fruits of his industry.
He can not defend his wife against insult. He can not protect his
children from violence. He can not live with his family if it
does not suit the interests of another man. He can not educate
his children. He can not choose an employment for them. He
can not hope for anything but slavery. He can not worship God
when he pleases. He can not testify in a court of justice.—Now
what does God think of all this? “I hate oppression,” is
his reply. “Remove not the landmarks of the widow,” he
says, “their cry will come before him; their Redeemer is mighty.”
“Go to, now, ye rich men, weep and howl; the hire of the laborers
who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back
by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are
entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.” Not a day, not
an hour probably passes in which some oppressed petitioner is
not filing his petition in the chancery of heaven against the slave-owners
of our land.</p>

<p>We have probably had more indignation than sympathy for
these men. And yet they are to be pitied. Probably none of
us have been as deeply indignant at the sins of oppressors as
Moses was at the idolatry of his people at the very base of Sinai.
And yet when the Lord threatened to cut off Israel and raise
up the promised nation from him, he prayed thus for them:
“Forgive their sin;—and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of
thy book which thou hast written!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>We can not then have exhausted the duty of prayer for the
overthrow of oppression till our sympathies and intercessions
have embraced the slave-owners as well as the slaves.</p>

<p>And there are peculiar encouragements for seeking the abolition
of slavery by prayer.</p>

<p>1. God’s special readiness to hear prayer when his people
are in straits. Notice the sketches of personal and national history
in the Bible. How many of them are recorded in order to
show how ready God is to deliver his people when in their perplexities
they cry unto him. Jacob, Moses, David, Hezekiah,
Mordecai, Nehemiah, the church in Jerusalem when Peter was
in prison. “Now these things were for our ensamples.”</p>

<p>2. The time of terminating an infliction has come when it
has produced an humble and hearty return to God.</p>

<p>3. The mode of deliverance thus secured will be the best.
An end might be put to slavery by a civil war; but the remedy
would be unspeakably worse than the disease. But suppose the
church of God to take up this matter with an humble, united
heart; and before the world and God become, like Moses, an intercessor,
and ready to employ other means subsequently and
subordinately, we can not doubt that slavery would come to an
end; and then observe with what blessed results:</p>

<p>What glory to God! He will be acknowledged as holy, as
gracious, as powerful, as a hearer of prayer.</p>

<p>What benefits to the slave! Liberty, elevation, knowledge,
all social and civil blessings.</p>

<p>What relief to the master!—from crime, from the consciousness
of wrong-doing, from fear, from a bondage of dependence,
unthriftiness, and numberless vexations.</p>

<p>What blessings to the country! Asperities all softened. North,
South, East and West united in one brotherhood; the nation
honored in the approbation of the world; Freedom a grand
reality for all.</p>

<p>What advantage to the cause of Christ! Christians henceforth
one; wounds healed; the way of usefulness unobstructed;
the church hastening with united strength, and with the blessing
of God, to the spiritual conquest of the world!</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
